- 👋 Hi, I’m Leonie, a PhD student at MPI MiS Leipzig!
- 👀 I’m interested in Algebraic Geometry, Commutative Algebra and its interactions with Computational Complexity Theory. Also LaTeX
- 📝 I’m wrote my master's thesis in mathematics on the *Waring problem for polynomials* and my thesis in computer science on *Gröbner Bases and Their Complexity*
